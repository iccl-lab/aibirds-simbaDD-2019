The src folder contains all the java source codes of the software. 

The following are the files you may want to modify:

========= Files under /src/ab/demo/ =====================				
ClientNaiveAgent.java : A server/client version of the Naive agent that interacts with the server by the pre-defined protocols
NaiveAgent.java : A standardalone implementation of the Naive agent. You can run this agent without the server.

======== Files under /src/ab/demo/other/ ================

ActionRobot.java : A java util class for the standalone version. It provides common functions an agent would use. E.g. get the screenshot

ClientActionRobot.java : A server/client version of the java util class that encodes client messages and decodes the corresponding server messages complying with the protocols. Its subclass is ClientActionRobotJava.java which decodes the received server messages into java objects.

LoadingLevelSchema.java / RestartLevelSchema.java / ShootingSchema.java : Those files are only for the standalone version. A standalone agent can use the schemas respectively to load levels, restart levels, and launch birds. 

======== Files under /src/ab/planner/ ====================

TrajectoryPlanner.java : Implementation of the trajectory module

=======  Files under /src/ab/vision ======================

All the files under this folder are vision files.

Vision.java ï¼š the primary implementation of the vision module. 

====== Files under /src/external ===========================

ClientMessageEncoder.java : encode the client messages according to the protocols

ClientMessageTable.java : a table that maintains all the client messages and its corresponding MIDs.

=== SimbaDD ===
===============

the following files are the main entry points into this project that were added by the SimbaDD team:

===== Files under /src/demo ================================

SimulationAgent.java : our agent used in the competition

/other/LevelSelectionStrategy : our strategy used to figure out which level to try/repeat next

===== Files under /src/simulation ==========================

/factory/BodyFactory.java : creates the Body Objects used by the jbox2d engine from the ab.vision Objects
/view/DummySimulationView.java : does nothing, used if run in the background
/view/DefaultSimulationView.java : simple renderer, capable of drawing the scene and some physics parameters
/model/level/GenericLevel.java : tries to implement the game mechanics of Angry Birds, i.e. objects getting destroyed, bird abilities, etc., as close as possible
SimulationManager.java : Manages multiple Simulations on ab.simulation.utils.Constants.NUMBER_OF_THREADS number of Threads. The order of the shots is not necessarily the order of the results. If a simulation finishes earlier than another it's further up the list but it can move only up to number of threads places up the list from its position in the list of shots.
SimulationResult.java : simple tuple that implements Comparable and stores the score and the list of consecutive shots the score was achieved with.
